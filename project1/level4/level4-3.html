      <p class="contents">
  		I <br>bring <br>fresh showers <br>for the <br>thirsting flowers, 
         <br>From the <br>seas and the streams; 
<br>I <br>bear light <br>shade for the leaves when <br>laid 
         In their noonday dreams. 
<br>From my wings <br>are shaken the dews  that waken 
         <br>The sweet buds every one, 
<br>When rocked to rest on their mother's breast, 
         <br>As she dances about the sun. 
<br>I <br>wield the flail of the lashing hail, 
         <br>And &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp whiten the green plains under, 
<br>And &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp then again I dissolve it in rain, 
         <br>And &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp laugh &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp as &nbsp&nbsp I pass in thunder. 

   <br>I <br>sift the snow on the mountains below, 
         <br>And &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp their great pines groan aghast; 
<br>And &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp all &nbsp&nbspthe &nbsp&nbspnight it &nbsp&nbsp&nbspis my pillow white, 
         <br>While I sleep in the arms of the blast. 
<br>Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers, 
         <br>Lightning my pilot sits; 
<br>In a cavern under is fettered the thunder, 
         <br>It struggles and howls at fits; 
<br>Over&nbsp&nbsp earth&nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbspocean, with &nbsp&nbspgentle &nbsp&nbspmotion, 
         <br>This pilot is guiding me,<br> 
Lured by the love of the genii that move 
         <br>In the depths of the purple sea;<br> 
Over &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp rills, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp crags, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp hills, 
         <br>Over &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp lakes &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp plains, <br>
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream, 
         <br>The Spirit he loves remains; 
<br>And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile, 
         <br>Whilst he is dissolving in rains. 

   <br>I <br>am the daughter of Earth and Water, 
         <br>And the nursling of the Sky; 
<br>I <br> pass through the pores of the ocean and shores; 
         <br>I <br>change, but I cannot die. 
<br>For after the rain when with never a stain 
         <br>The pavilion of Heaven is bare, 
<br>And the winds and sunbeams with <br>their convex gleams 
         <br>Build up the blue dome of air, 
<br>I <br> silently <br>laugh at my own cenotaph, 
         <br>And out of <br>the caverns of rain, 
<br>Like a child <br>from the womb, <br>like a ghost <br>from the tomb, 
         <br>I <br>arise and <br>unbuild it <br><br>again.
