  		<br><br><h6> <em>By Percy Bysshe Shelley</h6></em>
  		<br><br>

      I bring <br><br>fresh <strong>showers</strong> for the thirsting flowers, <br><br>
         From the <strong>seas</strong> and the <strong>streams</strong>; <br><br>
I bear <strong>light shade</strong> for the <strong>leaves</strong> <br><br>when laid 
         <h3>In their noonday dreams.</h3> <br><br>
From my <strong>wings</strong> are shaken the dews <br><br>that waken 
         The sweet <strong>buds </strong>every one,<br><br> 
When rocked to rest on their mother's breast, 
         <br><br>
        As she dances about the <strong>sun</strong>. <br><br>
I wield the flail of the lashing hail, 
         <br><br><h5><strong>And</strong> whiten the green plains under, 
<br><br><strong>And</strong> then again I dissolve it in rain, </h5>
         <br><br><h5><strong>And</strong> laugh as I pass in thunder.</h5> 

   <br><br>I sift the snow on the mountains below, 
         <br><br><h5><strong>And</strong> their great pines groan aghast; 
<br><br>And all the night 'tis my pillow white, </h5>
         <br><br>While I sleep in the <strong>arms </strong>of the blast. <br><br>
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers, 
         <br><br>Lightning my <strong>pilot sits</strong>; <br><br>
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder, 
        <br><br> It struggles and howls at fits; 
<br><br><strong>Over</strong> earth and ocean, <br><br>with gentle motion, <br><br>
         This pilot is guiding me, <br><br>
Lured by the love of the genii <br><br>that move 
         In the depths of the purple sea;<br><br> <h6>
<strong>Over</strong> the rills, and the crags, and the hills,</h6> <br><br>
         <h6><strong>Over</strong> the lakes and the plains,<br><br> 
Wherever he dream, <br><br>under mountain or stream, </h6>
         <br><br>The Spirit he loves remains; <br><br>
And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile, 
        <br><br> Whilst he is dissolving in rains. 

   <br><br><h3>I am the daughter of Earth and Water, </h3>
         <br><br>And the nursling of the <strong>Sky</strong>; 
<br><br>I pass through the pores of the <strong>ocean</strong> and <strong>shores</strong>; 
         <h4><br><br>I change, but I cannot die. </h4>

<br><br>I silently laugh at my own cenotaph, 
         <br><br>And out of the caverns of rain, 
<h6><br><br>Like a child from the womb, <br><br>like a ghost from the tomb, </h6>
         <strong><br><br>I arise and unbuild it again. </strong>
