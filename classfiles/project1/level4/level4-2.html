   <h2>The Cloud </h2>
</header>
   <h5 class="people4"><em>By Percy Bysshe Shelley</em></h5>

   <div class="line4">
   <p class="add"> I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,</p> 
         <p>From the seas and the streams;</p>

<p class="add">I bear light shade for the leaves when laid </p>
         <p>In their noonday dreams.</p> 
<p class="add">From my wings are shaken the dews that waken </p>
         <p>The sweet buds every one, </p>
<p class="add">When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,</p> 
         <p> As she dances about the sun.
         </p> 
<p class="add">I wield the flail of the lashing hail,</p> 
         <p>And whiten the green plains under, </p>
<p class="add">And then again I dissolve it in rain,</p> 
         <p>And laugh as I pass in thunder. </p>
     </div>

 <div class="line4">
 <p class="add">    I am the daughter of Earth and Water, </p>
         <p>And the nursling of the Sky;</p> 
<p class="add">I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores; </p>
         <p>I change, but I cannot die. </p>
<p class="add">For after the rain when with never a stain </p>
         <p>The pavilion of Heaven is bare, </p>
<p class="add">And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams </p>
         <p>Build up the blue dome of air,</p> 
<p class="add">I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,</p> 
         <p>And out of the caverns of rain, </p>
<p class="add">Like a child from the womb,</p><p> like a ghost from the tomb, </p>
         <p>I arise and unbuild it again.</p>
